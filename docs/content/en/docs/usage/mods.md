  How to install, view and manage your mods in Vortex.
---

At it's core, installing mods is roughly the same as any Vortex-enabled game, once you've added Ace Combat 7 as a managed game in Vortex.

If you haven't already, open the Games screen and click the **Manage** button on the Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown icon under *Unmanaged*

## Installing from Nexus Mods

If you're installing mods from Nexus Mods, you can use the "Vortex" or "Download with Mod Manager" buttons on the mod page to automatically open Vortex and download the mod. Simply Install and Enable like usual and you should be good to go.

### Installing archives with multiple mod files

If you install a file from Nexus Mods that has multiple game mod files (i.e. `.pak` files), you will see a prompt that should walk you through the process of choosing which mod files you want to install. 

### Managing your skin slots

If you install a lot of skin mods, you will likely run into problems where you have multiple mods that replace the same skin slot. Since 0.1.0, AceVortex will attempt to read which slot a skin replaces when you install a mod. If you install multiple mods that replace the same aircraft skin, you'll get a warning when you deploy. At any time, you can also check which skins a mod includes by double-clicking the mod in the Mods list and checking the details in the panel on the right.

> You can also use the gear icon at the top right of the Mods screen to enable the *Skin(s)* column and quickly check your installed skins, right from the Mods list

## Install from archives

You can also download mod archives directly from Nexus Mods or anywhere else you like and install them with Vortex. Simply use the *Install From File* button in the toolbar or drop them onto the drop zone at the bottom of the Vortex window.

> Be aware that installing from non-Nexus archives will often not include the full metadata. You can double-click the mod in the mod list to change its details.
