# Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown support for Vortex

This extension adds support for Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown mods to the Vortex mod manager.

> This extension is still in preview, please report any issues you find! 

## What is it?

This is a simple Vortex extension that adds support for Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown mods so that you can install game mods using the Vortex mod manager.

Using Vortex, you can install, manage, track and uninstall mods for Fell Seal just like you install mod archives for any of the other Vortex-supported games.

## A word of warning

Because of how AC7 mods work, you will almost certainly hit incompatibilities! Vortex will warn you when mods try to overwrite each other, but since it doesn't read inside the pak files, it won't know if two mods overwrite the same skin slot, for example. You can easily enable/disable conflicting mods though!

## How to use it?

You can install the extension either from the CI builds (click the Actions tab above), or by installing it directly from Vortex's Extensions pane. Restart Vortex and you should be good to go.

> Most of the installation steps shown will require Advanced Mode to be enabled in Vortex! Enable it in the Settings window, under Interface > Advanced > Enable Advanced Mode.

Please report any bugs or issues you find as I have only been able to complete some basic (and limited) testing with this extension.
