&lt;div class="pageinfo pageinfo-primary">
&lt;p>This release is now available &lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/125?tab=files">on Nexus Mods&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>This release is a minor update on the &lt;a href="./updates/v0.2.1">previous alpha&lt;/a> with some more minor fixes and improvements. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read the notes for the last feature release, please &lt;a href="./updates/v0.2.0">check them out&lt;/a>! This fix release adds the following tweaks:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Improvements to Skins view
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>There&amp;rsquo;s a new &amp;ldquo;Find more&amp;rdquo; button for each aircraft allowing you to quickly search Nexus Mods for skins for a specific aircraft&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We&amp;rsquo;ve also cleaned up the layout so long aircraft lists should wrap/scroll/align properly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some more improvements to skin detection
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We should no longer incorrectly identify weapon skins as an aircraft&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Manually refreshing skins (using the &lt;em>Refresh Skins&lt;/em> action) will now remove &amp;ldquo;stale&amp;rdquo;/incorrect skins for a mod&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>All of the automatic skin slot features are a) very new and potentially not 100% stable and b) not guaranteed to work. Depending on how the mod was packed, we might not be able to auto-detect the slot and you will have to keep track of those mods yourself.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>As always, please report any issues you find &lt;a href="https://github.com/agc93/acevortex">on GitHub&lt;/a>. If things go really awry, you can also turn off the new installer in the Settings page and see if that resolves any issues you&amp;rsquo;re facing during installation&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: Alpha 2.1 Release</title><link>/blog/2020/09/21/alpha-2.1-release/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2020/09/21/alpha-2.1-release/</guid><description>

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>This release is a minor update on the &lt;a href="./updates/v0.2.0">previous big alpha&lt;/a> with some smaller fixes. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read the notes for the last release, please check them out! This fix release adds the following tweaks:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>NPC Skins handled much better
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>NPC skins will now be sorted to the bottom of the skin list for each aircraft so you can focus on your playable skins&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can also hide NPC skins from the skin view using the &amp;ldquo;Include NPC slots&amp;rdquo; checkbox at the top of the page&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hiding NPC slots won&amp;rsquo;t remove them or skip conflict detection, it will just hide the entries in the skin list&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some more improvements to skin detection
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Added a minor fix for an edge case we hadn&amp;rsquo;t accounted for (thanks Sly!)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>This release is a feature update on the &lt;a href="./updates/v0.1.5">previous alpha&lt;/a> with some pretty big new additions:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>AceVortex now reads skin slots from mod files much more reliably
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I mean &lt;strong>a lot&lt;/strong> more reliably so almost any mod available on Nexus Mods today should have its slots automatically detected after installation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you had mods that weren&amp;rsquo;t detected previously, use Refresh Skins from the context menu to try again with the new version&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We also now show much better/more accurate names for aircraft (no more PKFA or RFLM)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>New Skins page for checking your installed skin mods!
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>This new page added to the left menu bar lets you view all your enabled skin mods sorted by aircraft and slot&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can quickly check what mods you have installed for each aircraft and each slot at a glance&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Big thanks to SlyCooperFan and the rest of #ac-modding for helping with feedback and ideas on this one!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;div class="pageinfo pageinfo-primary">
&lt;p>This release is now available &lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/125?tab=files">on Nexus Mods&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>This release is a minor upgrade on the &lt;a href="./updates/v0.1.4">previous alpha&lt;/a> with some minor fixes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Vortex will now fix/rename older mod files more reliably
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>While &lt;a href="(/updates/v0.1.4)">0.1.4&lt;/a> would rename most files, it would not rename mods only containing one pak file. This has now been fixed!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thanks to @Azekthi for reporting this &lt;a href="https://github.com/agc93/acevortex">on GitHub&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Skin detection now happens when any mod is installed rather than as part of the advanced installer
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Among other things, this means mods with FOMODs will still have skins detected automatically.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some more minor bugfixes and refactoring in preparation for some planned features&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>This release is a minor upgrade on the &lt;a href="./updates/v0.1.3">previous alpha&lt;/a> with some small, but important, changes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Vortex will now fix/rename older mod files
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>AC7 requires any mod files that touch post-launch content (skin slots, DLC planes, planes with extra slots) to have a name ending in &lt;code>_P&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>By default, we now rename any files that don&amp;rsquo;t have this suffix on installation. This can be turned off in Settings.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thanks to @Azekthi for suggesting this &lt;a href="https://github.com/agc93/acevortex">on GitHub&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>README files in mods will now be installed &lt;em>properly&lt;/em>. There was a bug that could result in duplicate READMEs or none at all.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some more minor bugfixes and refactoring in preparation for some planned features&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>This release is a minor upgrade on the &lt;a href="./updates/v0.1.2">previous alpha&lt;/a> with some small, but important, changes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>README files in mods will now be installed
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If a mod contains only one &lt;code>.txt&lt;/code> file, AceVortex will assume it&amp;rsquo;s a README file and install it to a seperate &lt;code>README&lt;/code> folder in your &lt;code>~mods&lt;/code> folder&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can turn this behaviour off in Settings&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>INI tweaks added
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We&amp;rsquo;ve added a section to the Workarounds tab of the Settings page for INI tweaks/workarounds&lt;/li>
&lt;li>At this time, the only included tweak is a possible fix for blurry textures with certain skin mods&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some more minor bugfixes and refactoring in the installer and settings&lt;/li>

&lt;div class="pageinfo pageinfo-primary">
&lt;p>This release is now available &lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/125?tab=files">on Nexus Mods&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>This release is a smaller fix and upgrade on the &lt;a href="./updates/v0.1.1">previous alpha&lt;/a> with some small, but important, changes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>More bugs fixed in the advanced installer
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>This includes a bug when installing multiple &amp;ldquo;root-level&amp;rdquo; paks from an archive and inconsistent results for different archive layouts&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We now &lt;em>correctly&lt;/em> track what files you choose when installing archives with multiple mods
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Last release we saved this information in mod notes, which was pretty hacky&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Now, the installer uses a new attribute and you can always check what files you installed using the details panel (double click on the mod in your Mods list)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Unfortunately, this won&amp;rsquo;t be applied retroactively so will only appear for newly installed or reinstalled mods&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>All of the automatic skin slot features are a) very new and potentially not 100% stable and b) not guaranteed to work. Depending on how the mod was packed, we might not be able to auto-detect the slot and you will have to keep track of those mods yourself.&lt;/p>

&lt;div class="pageinfo pageinfo-primary">
&lt;p>This release is now available &lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/125?tab=files">on Nexus Mods&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>This release is another big upgrade on the &lt;a href="./updates/v0.1.0">previous alpha&lt;/a> with a bunch of new features!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The biggest change in this release is that we&amp;rsquo;ve added proper integration for skin mods, including skin slot detection! When you install a skins mod (assuming you use the &lt;a href="./updates/v0.1.0">new and improved installer&lt;/a>), Vortex will read the &lt;code>.pak&lt;/code> files you install and try and automatically detect what aircraft and slot the mod is intended for. You can check what skins a mod provides in the details panel (double-click on the mod in the Mods list).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whenever you deploy your mods, AceVortex will also run a quick check to try and see if any of your mods are trying to replace the same slot and give you a warning so you can change what slots you are using. For any skin mods you had installed before this update, you can right-click the Mod and select &amp;ldquo;Refresh Skins&amp;rdquo; to auto-detect the skin slots.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>All of the automatic skin slot features are a) very new and potentially not 100% stable and b) not guaranteed to work. Depending on how the mod was packed, we might not be able to auto-detect the slot and you will have to keep track of those mods yourself.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Other changes in this release include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Installer will now include what paks you chose as mod notes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Improved installer when installing &amp;ldquo;all&amp;rdquo; paks in a mod&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Added skin slot attribute with slot names&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A lot of behind-the-scenes refactoring for the new installer&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This is all-new functionality so please report any issues you find &lt;a href="https://github.com/agc93/acevortex">on GitHub&lt;/a>. If things go really awry, you can also turn off the new installer in the Settings page.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: Alpha 1 Release</title><link>/blog/2020/07/02/alpha-1-release/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2020/07/02/alpha-1-release/</guid><description>
&lt;div class="pageinfo pageinfo-primary">
&lt;p>This release is now available &lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/125?tab=files">on Nexus Mods&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>This release is a significant upgrade on the &lt;a href="./updates/v0.0.2">previous pre-alpha&lt;/a> so we&amp;rsquo;ve bumped this release up to alpha status: version 0.1.0!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most notable change in this release is a complete rebuild of the installer logic that will now detect when you&amp;rsquo;re installing an archive with multiple mod files and walk you through which files to install. This should dramatically improve mod compatibility, especially with a lot of the mods currently available on Nexus Mods.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is all-new logic so please report any issues you find &lt;a href="https://github.com/agc93/acevortex">on GitHub&lt;/a>. If things go really awry, you can also turn off the new installer in the Settings page.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: Alpha 0.2 Release</title><link>/blog/2020/05/25/alpha-0.2-release/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2020/05/25/alpha-0.2-release/</guid><description>

&lt;p>This release is a minor update to &lt;a href="./updates/v0.0.1">the first alpha&lt;/a> of the AceVortex extension! We just had to clear up a minor error in how we register the installer with Vortex to avoid compatibility problems.&lt;/p>
