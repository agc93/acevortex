This release is a very minor fix update in preparation for the new DLC updates. 

The new update adds three new planes and they've now been added to the skin detection so once you install some skins for the new CFA-44, XFA-27 and ASF-X, they'll correctly show up in the mod details and Skins view.

> All of the automatic skin slot features are a) very new and potentially not 100% stable and b) not guaranteed to work. Depending on how the mod was packed, we might not be able to auto-detect the slot and you will have to keep track of those mods yourself.

As always, please report any issues you find [on GitHub](https://github.com/agc93/acevortex). If things go really awry, you can also turn off the new installer in the Settings page and see if that resolves any issues you're facing during installation
