This release is a small update on the [previous alpha](/updates/v0.3.1) with some minor fixes and updates:

- Added extra names for EAS aircraft
  - Aircraft unlocked as part of the EAS DLC should now have their proper names in the Skins attributes and overview.
  - Note that these aircraft may or may not be available when you get this update!
- Minor fixes and refactoring
  - There's a bunch of minor cleanups and refactorings behind the scenes in this update
  - You shouldn't really see anything different as a result of this but hopefully a few features will be a little more stable.
  - Please report any issues you hit after this update on Nexus or on Discord.

> All of the automatic skin slot features are a) very new and potentially not 100% stable and b) not guaranteed to work. Depending on how the mod was packed, we might not be able to auto-detect the slot and you will have to keep track of those mods yourself.

As always, please report any issues you find [on GitHub](https://github.com/agc93/acevortex).
