This release is a minor update to [the first alpha](/updates/v0.0.1) of the AceVortex extension! We just had to clear up a minor error in how we register the installer with Vortex to avoid compatibility problems.

You should be able to install mods for AC7 from Nexus Mods or external archives in this release and support the basic Vortex features of install/enable/disable/deploy/purge.
