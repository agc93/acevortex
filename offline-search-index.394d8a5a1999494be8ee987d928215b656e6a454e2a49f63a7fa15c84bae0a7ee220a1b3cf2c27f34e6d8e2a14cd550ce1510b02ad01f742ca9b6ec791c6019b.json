[{"body":"AceVortex is an unofficial extension for the\nAceVortex is an unofficial extension for the Vortex mod manager that adds support for installing and managing Ace Combat 7 Skies Unknown mods in Vortex, just like any other supported title. To clarify, this project is not affiliated in any way with Nexus Mods, Project Aces or anyone else, and is an open-source community resource.\nStatus and Limitations AceVortex is still beta-quality software! While I can test locally, I won’t be able to cover every case and there is a high potential for bugs that haven’t been found yet. The following is definitely supported at this point:\n Installing mods: Installing mods from archive files works, deploying directly to your install directory. Managing mods: The standard Vortex install/enable/disable/uninstall operations should all work just as they do for any other Vortex-managed game. Profiles: Create multiple profiles for different sets of mods and quickly switch between them.  There’s some features that we’ve included to get them in your hands as fast as possible, but might still have some rough edges:\n Improved installation for skins: The extension will now attempt to detect when an archive contains mod files for multiple skins or slots and walk you through installing them.   If you’re really missing specific features you can open an issue and we can discuss the viability, or find me on the Nexus Mods Discord.\n Nexus Mods To be clear and upfront: being supported in Vortex (using AceVortex) does not mean that the Nexus Mods or Vortex team officially supports this extension or any mods you install using it. See the FAQ for extra details.\nThe Nexus team has, however, enabled Vortex integration on Nexus Mods for AC7 so once you have the extension installed you can use the Vortex buttons on the site to quickly install mods.\n","excerpt":"AceVortex is an unofficial extension for the\nAceVortex is an …","ref":"/docs/introduction/","title":"Introduction"},{"body":" This site includes only the guides for getting started with AceVortex and managing AC7 mods with Vortex.

You don’t! If you prefer installing and managing your mods manually, or using any other modding tools, I recommend using them! AceVortex is just an alternate method of installing mods for those who are more familiar with Vortex already. In particular, installing AC7 mods manually is not particularly arduous if you are used to it.\nI’m a mod/pack author, how do I make mods compatible with Vortex?  This is a complicated answer, and we have more details in the developer docs to explain the reasoning and how to work with Vortex.\n The over-simplified answer is that Vortex works best when a single mod archive (i.e. a file on Nexus Mods) contains just one .pak mod file in it. This is usually impractical for AC7 (especially with skin mods), so the installer will try to detect and adapt to different mod structures to make installing mods easier, even when they’re not packaged how Vortex likes them.\nIn particular, note that the installer will only deploy .pak files (and sometimes any other files in the folder containing those .pak files), so anything in other folders shouldn’t impact compatibility.\nWhat about mods that aren’t on the Nexus? They should still work fine! Download the archive file and install it using Vortex’s standard “Install from File” button. You might be prompted to choose what files you want installed, and also remember that non-Nexus mods won’t have quite the same metadata available in Vortex you might be used to.\nThe installer prompt failed and now I can’t install my mod?! If you are facing problems installing mods with multiple .pak files, you may have found a problem in the advanced installer that AceVortex uses to cut down on conflicts. First, head to your Settings page in Vortex and turn off the Enable Interactive Installer toggle under the Enable Advanced Installer for AC7 section and try to install your mod again.\nIf that works, please raise an issue on GitHub and make sure to link/include which mod you’re trying to install. We’re always trying to improve mod compatibility and you might have just found a bug!\n","excerpt":"Below is a collection of frequent questions and the best answers I can …","ref":"/docs/introduction/faq/","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"body":"Quick Start The fastest way to get started is to just open the Games page in Vortex and scroll down through the unmanaged games. You should see an entry for Ace Combat 7 Skies Unknown in there. Click Manage on that entry and follow the prompts to install the extension and restart Vortex. You should be good to go and try installing some mods!\nInstalling the Extension If the quick start doesn’t work or you want to install the extension yourself, there’s a couple of different ways to do that! Unless you’ve got a pretty specific use case, you’ll probably want one of the two automatic methods, but manual installation is available as well.\nAutomatic Installation  This is the easiest way to install!\n  Open up Vortex, and open the Extensions panel from the left sidebar. Click Find more to open the list of Extensions Find Ace Combat 7 Skies Unknown Support and click Install Wait for the extension to install and restart Vortex when prompted.  Once Vortex has restarted, just click the Manage button on Ace Combat 7 in your Games screen and you’re ready to install some mods!\nSemi-Automatic Installation If you can’t install directly from the Extensions screen, you can instead install from the archive.\n Download the archive from Nexus Mods or GitHub Open the Extensions panel in Vortex Click on the Drop File(s) box in the corner and locate the archive you downloaded. Wait for the extension to install and restart Vortex when prompted.  Once Vortex has restarted, just click the Manage button on Ace Combat in your Games screen and you’re ready to install some mods!\nManual Installation  Only attempt this if you absolutely have to. It becomes much harder to debug and much harder to upgrade.\n If you want to install the extension yourself, you will have to install the actual extension files manually. Make sure you close Vortex before proceeding.\nFirst, download the archive from Nexus Mods or GitHub.\nNext, unpack the archive to somewhere convenient. You should have a directory named game-acecombat7skiesunknown with at least three files inside:\n info.json index.js gameart.png  Now, copy the whole directory to your Vortex folder. You can easily open your Vortex folder by opening a new File Explorer window and entering the following in to the location bar: %APPDATA%/Vortex and then opening the plugins directory (create it if it doesn’t exist).\nOnce you’re done, you should have three files at the following locations:\nC:\\Users\\\u003cyour-user-name-here\u003e\\AppData\\Roaming\\Vortex\\plugins\\game-acecombat7skiesunknown\\info.json C:\\Users\\\u003cyour-user-name-here\u003e\\AppData\\Roaming\\Vortex\\plugins\\game-acecombat7skiesunknown\\index.js C:\\Users\\\u003cyour-user-name-here\u003e\\AppData\\Roaming\\Vortex\\plugins\\game-acecombat7skiesunknown\\gameart.png With those files in place, you’re clear to start Vortex and you should see the C\u0026C Remastered icon in the Games screen light up.\n","excerpt":"Quick Start The fastest way to get started is to just open the Games …","ref":"/docs/usage/installation/","title":"Installation"},{"body":"At it’s core, installing mods is roughly the same as any Vortex-enabled game, once you’ve added C\u0026C Remastered as a managed game in Vortex.\nIf you haven’t already, open the Games screen and click the Manage button on the Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown icon under Unmanaged\n Installing from Nexus Mods If you’re installing mods from Nexus Mods, you can use the “Vortex” or “Download with Mod Manager” buttons on the mod page to automatically open Vortex and download the mod. Simply Install and Enable like usual and you should be good to go.\nInstalling archives with multiple mod files If you install a file from Nexus Mods that has multiple game mod files (i.e. .pak files), you will see a prompt that should walk you through the process of choosing which mod files you want to install. Remember that since Vortex doesn’t actually read your game files, it won’t be able to detect skin slot conflicts automatically.\nManaging your skin slots If you install a lot of skin mods, you will likely run into problems where you have multiple mods that replace the same skin slot. Since 0.1.0, AceVortex will attempt to read which slot a skin replaces when you install a mod. If you install multiple mods that replace the same aircraft skin, you’ll get a warning when you deploy. At any time, you can also check which skins a mod includes by double-clicking the mod in the Mods list and checking the details in the panel on the right.\nInstall from archives You can also download mod archives directly from Nexus Mods or anywhere else you like and install them with Vortex. Simply use the Install From File button in the toolbar or drop them onto the drop zone at the bottom of the Vortex window.\n Be aware that installing from non-Nexus archives will often not include the full metadata. You can double-click the mod in the mod list to change its details.\n ","excerpt":"At it’s core, installing mods is roughly the same as any …","ref":"/docs/usage/mods/","title":"Installing Mods"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/blog/releases/","title":"Releases"},{"body":" This site includes only the guides for getting started with the extension and managing Ace Combat mods with Vortex.

Awesome!\nIn general terms, you need to install the extension, then install some mods and you’re ready to play!\n","excerpt":" This site includes only the guides for getting started with the …","ref":"/docs/usage/","title":"Usage"},{"body":"Customising metadata You can customise the basic metadata of any of your mods (name, author, notes etc) using Vortex’s built-in sidebar. Just double-click on the name of any mod in your mod list and you’ll get a small dialog where you can change the name and author, or add some notes for yourself. It’s not recommended to change the source or mod type as these control how mods are handled internally.\nProfiles Just like any other Vortex game, you can have multiple profiles configured for different mod selections. Want an easier way to switch between certain sets of skins? Don’t want to use all your wild skins every time you play? Set up profiles and you can easily switch between them to keep your mod installs separate. You can create a new profile from the Profiles screen by either cloning your exising one (from the Edit dropdown menu), or clicking Add “Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown” Profile.\nChecking installed files If you installed a mod using the guided installer, it’s possible you only installed some .pak files from the original mod archive. If you need to check which files you installed for any reason, you can find them in the mod details panel. Double click the relevant mod in the Mods list and scroll down in the panel on the right to find out how many files you installed. Click on the summary (i.e. 2 installed files) to see exactly which files you chose to isntall.\nPurging to default If you want to take your game back to a default, unmodded state, you can use Vortex’s Purge feature. Click the Purge Mods button from the Mods list and Vortex will undeploy all your enabled mods, leaving your game directory essentially unmodded.\nRemoving or resetting AceVortex If you want to completely reset AceVortex so that you can start over from scratch, first uninstall all your currently installed mods from the Mods list. Once you’ve done that (and deployed!) jump to the Profiles screen, and choose Remove from the dropdown menu beside the edit button for the “Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown - Default” profile. This will effectively reset your Vortex so that AC7 will reappear as an available, unmanaged game in the Games list.\nTo remove AceVortex entirely, you should uninstall and remove all your installed mods from the Mods list first. After deploying, you can then remove the Default profile (see above), and finally uninstall the extension itself by clicking over to the Extensions screen. AceVortex will appear near the end of the list as “Game: Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown”. Click Remove to uninstall AceVortex.\n Note that AC7 will still show up in your Games list since Vortex can redownload the extension from Nexus Mods.\n Multiple Installation Variants If you don’t like the specific skin/slot choices you made when you installed one of your mods, remember that you can always reinstall the mod and use Vortex’s variant functionality to easily switch between multiple versions of the same mod without affecting the rest of your mod list.\nINI Workarounds If skins you install appear very blurry in game, it’s possible there’s a problem with the skin’s mipmapping and how AC7 loads skin textures. There are a couple of keys you can add to your game’s configuration file using the tweaks in the Workarounds tab of the Settings page.\n","excerpt":"Customising metadata You can customise the basic metadata of any of …","ref":"/docs/usage/configuration/","title":"Configuration"},{"body":"AceVortex is fully open-source!

Also remember that we are limited to features that Vortex can reasonably support. Open an issue on GitHub to discuss viability of any requests.\nA note on confusing code For anyone who decides to wade into the AceVortex code, there’s a few things worth remembering:\n I’m not a developer: This is just something I’m doing in my spare time, so don’t expect super-high-quality code. I’ll happily take fixes, though! Working with Vortex is weird: There’s quite a few quirks of the codebase that exist because of unfathomably mystifying behaviour in Vortex’s extension API. There are definitely missing edge cases: This started out as a basic prototype, so error handling and edge cases are definitely not at the standard we’d like. AC7 mods are almost always packaged weirdly: An unfortunate confluence in how AC7 handles mods/skins and how Vortex expects things to work means we’re having to wrangle a lot of things.  ","excerpt":"AceVortex is fully open-source! You can see the full code for the …","ref":"/docs/developer/","title":"Developer Guide"},{"body":"First off, I want to cover off one unfortunate reality of modding AC7 with Vortex: the way Vortex expects mods to work and the way AC7 handles mods don’t match up quite right.\nIn particular, Vortex (usually) expects each mod archive to have only one .pak mod file and for different variants of a mod to be distributed as separate files on Nexus Mods. This isn’t always practical though with mods often having multiple skins for multiple aircraft and then potentially multiplying that over multiple skin slots can make that untenable.\nAceVortex tries to find a middle ground as much as possible.\n If you’re a skin mod author and want to improve the experience for users, also check out ACMI. It’s a simple tool that can automatically generate Mod Installer files (aka FOMOD files) for your skin mods. Just include the fomod directory that ACMI generates in your mod archive when you upload it and Vortex will automatically use them to show users a nice guided wizard/installer to choose what files to install.\n In an ideal world, each mod archive would only have one .pak file in it. This doesn’t just make installation easier, this also gives us the potential for some extra features in future, like controlling load order or improving metadata.\nWhen a user installs a mod that has multiple .pak files, it runs a few checks and will start a guided process to install only the files it needs. The over-simplified version of the installation is this:\n If a mod only contains one .pak file, just install that by default If there are multiple paths in the mod that contain one or more .pak files, it will ask the user whether to install only some or all If any of the chosen paths contain more than one .pak file, it will also ask which specific .pak files to install, defaulting to all.  This should minimise the amount of friction for installing mods while also reducing the odds of a user installing conflicting skins/slots/etc.\n We also added a toggle in the Settings page to turn this behaviour off and just use the default behaviour, which is to install all the files found in the first path to contain a .pak file.\n ","excerpt":"First off, I want to cover off one unfortunate reality of modding AC7 …","ref":"/docs/developer/authoring/","title":"Packaging for Mod Authors"},{"body":" This release is now available on Nexus Mods.\n This release is a minor upgrade on the previous alpha with some minor fixes:\n Vortex will now fix/rename older mod files more reliably  While 0.1.4 would rename most files, it would not rename mods only containing one pak file.
