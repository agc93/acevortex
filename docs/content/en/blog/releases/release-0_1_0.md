This release is a significant upgrade on the [previous pre-alpha](/updates/v0.0.2) so we've bumped this release up to alpha status: version 0.1.0!

The most notable change in this release is a complete rebuild of the installer logic that will now detect when you're installing an archive with multiple mod files and walk you through which files to install. This should dramatically improve mod compatibility, especially with a lot of the mods currently available on Nexus Mods.

This is all-new logic so please report any issues you find [on GitHub](https://github.com/agc93/acevortex). If things go really awry, you can also turn off the new installer in the Settings page.
